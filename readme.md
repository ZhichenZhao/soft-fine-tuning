# Effective Domain Knowledge Transfer with Soft Fine-tuning

This project describes the methods of our arXiv paper "Effective Domain Knowledge Transfer with Soft Fine-tuning".

If you believe the proposed method is one of the variants of the method of multi-task learning or "learning without forgetting", just close the page.

In this paper, I just propose one small opinion: instead of the traditional fine-tuning schedule, maybe learning with the source domain improves generalization.

Anyway, welcome to discuss with me if you are insteresed in this opinion.
